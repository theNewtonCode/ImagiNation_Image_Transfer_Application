# ImagiNation_Image_Transfer_Application
‘ImagiNation’ is an app created for transferring images btw two PCs on  a local network. The objective is to produce a simple, secure, and user-friendly means for users to transmit and receive images to and from their PCs at very high speeds. The app’s GUI is constructed using Tkinter, and functionality is made using other powerful libraries. 
GUI explained:
We crafted the GUI of the application using the Tkinter, which is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI library. The GUI features 3 main windows: one that is the home window and road to two other windows which are for sending images and for receiving images.
In the sending window, users can explore their files and pick one or more images to send. They can also glimpse the IP address of their computer and a progress bar that reveals the status of the image transfer.
In the receiving window, users can input the IMN key generated by the computer that is sending images and choose a folder where they fancy to save the received images. They can also behold a list of available images on the sender's computer and a progress bar that reveals the status of the image transfer.
The image transfer process operates as follows:
•	The sender creates a TCP server socket and binds it to a port number.
•	The sender listens for incoming connections from receivers.
•	The receiver creates a TCP client socket and connects it to the sender's IP address and port number using the secret IMN key.
•	The sender accepts the connection from the receiver.
•	The sender sends the names and sizes of all available images to the receiver.
•	The receiver displays the list of available images on the GUI.
•	The receiver selects one or more images to receive and sends their names to the sender.
•	The sender sends each image in chunks of bytes to the receiver.
•	The receiver receives each image in chunks of bytes and saves it in the chosen folder.
•	The sender and receiver close their sockets after all images are transferred.
