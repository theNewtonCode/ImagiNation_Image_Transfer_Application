# ImagiNation Image Transfer Application

## Overview

'ImagiNation' is an application designed for transferring images between two PCs on a local network. The primary goal is to provide users with a simple, secure, and user-friendly method for transmitting and receiving images at high speeds. The application's graphical user interface (GUI) is built using Tkinter, accompanied by powerful libraries to enhance functionality.

## GUI Explanation

The GUI of the application is crafted using Tkinter, a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI library. It comprises three main windows:

1. **Home Window:** The initial window leading to the sending and receiving functionalities.

2. **Sending Window:** Users can explore their files, select one or more images for transmission, view their computer's IP address, and monitor the progress of the image transfer through a progress bar.

3. **Receiving Window:** Users can input the IMN key generated by the sending computer, choose a folder to save received images, view a list of available images on the sender's computer, and monitor the progress of the image transfer through a progress bar.

## Image Transfer Process

The image transfer process operates as follows:

1. The sender creates a TCP server socket and binds it to a port number.
2. The sender listens for incoming connections from receivers.
3. The receiver creates a TCP client socket and connects it to the sender's IP address and port number using the secret IMN key.
4. The sender accepts the connection from the receiver.
5. The sender sends the names and sizes of all available images to the receiver.
6. The receiver displays the list of available images on the GUI.
7. The receiver selects one or more images to receive and sends their names to the sender.
8. The sender sends each image in chunks of bytes to the receiver.
9. The receiver receives each image in chunks of bytes and saves it in the chosen folder.
10. The sender and receiver close their sockets after all images are transferred.
